## Welcome to SAMEZU environment

### Hammer bot 

Our goal is to give the community better chance to build what they want, and we will manage that with our free products.
Hammer bot is our first free product (but not the last), we think that no one should pay to use bots. They are here to help the community not divide it.

All you need to provide to use Hammer bot is configure the `config.json` file.
Populate `RPC url`, `private key` which will be used to buy and sell desired token, and `token` which you want to bump.
For `RPC url` we recommend [shyft](https://shyft.to/) their free tier is more than enough for most people.
